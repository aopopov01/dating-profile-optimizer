"THE COMPLETE GUIDE TO DATING PHOTO ORDER üì∏

Most people get this WRONG and it kills their match rate.

Here's the psychology-backed order that works:

üìç PHOTO 1: Clear face shot, genuine smile, well-lit
Why: First impression is everything. They decide to swipe in 0.5 seconds.

üìç PHOTO 2: Full body shot, doing something active
Why: Shows lifestyle and physical compatibility.

üìç PHOTO 3: Social proof (with friends, cropped appropriately)  
Why: Demonstrates you're socially connected and fun.

üìç PHOTO 4: Hobby/interest photo
Why: Conversation starter and personality showcase.

üìç PHOTO 5: Professional or dressed up
Why: Shows you can clean up nice and have ambitions.

üìç PHOTO 6: Candid moment (laughing, natural)
Why: Authenticity and warmth.

The order matters because of the 'recency effect' - people remember the last thing they see.
