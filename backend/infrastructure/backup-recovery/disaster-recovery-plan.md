## Recovery Architecture

### Multi-Region Setup

```
Primary Region (us-east-1)
├── Production API (3 instances)
├── PostgreSQL Master + Read Replica
├── Redis Cluster (3 nodes)
├── Monitoring Stack
└── Load Balancer

Secondary Region (us-west-2)
├── Standby API (1 instance, auto-scale to 3)
├── PostgreSQL Standby (streaming replication)
├── Redis Standby
├── Monitoring (reduced)
└── Load Balancer (inactive)

Tertiary Region (eu-west-1)
├── Cold Standby
├── Backup Storage
└── Emergency Access Point
```

### Data Replication Strategy

1. **Database**: Streaming replication with 30-second lag
2. **File Storage**: Cloudinary handles multi-region replication
3. **Configuration**: GitOps with automated sync
4. **Monitoring**: Cross-region dashboard replication

1. Confirm the incident scope and impact
2. Activate the disaster recovery team
3. Establish communication channels
4. Document incident start time

#### 1.3 Decision Matrix
| Scenario | Auto-Failover | Manual Intervention | Full DR |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|---------|
| API Timeout | ✅ | - | - |
| DB Connection Loss | ✅ | ✅ | - |
| Region Failure | ✅ | ✅ | - |
| Data Corruption | - | ✅ | ✅ |
| Security Breach | - | - | ✅ |

### Phase 2: Immediate Response (30-60 minutes)

#### 2.1 Traffic Diversion
```bash
# Update DNS to point to secondary region
aws route53 change-resource-record-sets \
  --hosted-zone-id Z123456789 \
  --change-batch file://failover-changeset.json

# Verify DNS propagation
dig api.datingoptimizer.com
```

#### 2.2 Service Status Communication
```bash
# Update status page
curl -X POST https://api.statuspage.io/v1/pages/PAGE_ID/incidents \
  -H "Authorization: OAuth API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "incident": {
      "name": "Service Disruption",
      "status": "investigating",
      "message": "We are investigating reports of service disruption."
    }
  }'
```

#### 2.3 Database Assessment
```bash
# Check primary database status
pg_isready -h primary-db.cluster-xxx.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com

# Promote standby to primary if needed
aws rds promote-read-replica \
  --db-instance-identifier dating-optimizer-replica-west
```

### Phase 3: Recovery Execution (1-4 hours)

#### 3.1 Infrastructure Recovery

##### Scenario A: Region Failover
```bash
# 1. Scale up secondary region
kubectl scale deployment dating-api --replicas=3 -n production

# 2. Update load balancer health checks
aws elbv2 modify-target-group \
  --target-group-arn arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:us-west-2:... \
  --health-check-enabled

# 3. Verify application connectivity
curl -f https://api.datingoptimizer.com/health
```

##### Scenario B: Database Recovery
```bash
# 1. Identify last known good backup
aws s3 ls s3://dating-optimizer-backups/database/ \
  --recursive | sort | tail -5

# 2. Restore from backup
pg_restore -h new-db-host -U postgres -d dating_optimizer \
  --verbose --clean --if-exists \
  s3://dating-optimizer-backups/database/dating_optimizer_full_20240101_020000.backup

# 3. Apply WAL files for point-in-time recovery
pg_wal_replay -D /var/lib/postgresql/data \
  -t "2024-01-01 14:30:00"
```

##### Scenario C: Complete Rebuild
```bash
# 1. Deploy infrastructure from Terraform
cd infrastructure/terraform
terraform init
terraform plan -var="environment=disaster_recovery"
terraform apply -auto-approve

# 2. Deploy application
kubectl apply -f ../k8s/production/
kubectl rollout status deployment/dating-api

# 3. Restore data
./backup-scripts/restore-full-backup.sh \
  --backup-date="2024-01-01_020000" \
  --target-host="new-db-cluster"
```

#### 3.2 Data Validation
```bash
# Database integrity checks
psql -h restored-db -d dating_optimizer -c "
  SELECT 
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    n_tup_ins,
    n_tup_upd,
    n_tup_del
  FROM pg_stat_user_tables 
  ORDER BY n_tup_ins DESC;
"

# Application health verification
curl -f https://api.datingoptimizer.com/api/health/detailed

# Sample data verification
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer test-token" \
  https://api.datingoptimizer.com/api/user/profile/test
```

### Phase 4: Service Restoration (2-4 hours)

#### 4.1 Gradual Traffic Restoration
```bash
# Canary deployment approach
# Start with 10% traffic
aws elbv2 modify-rule \
  --rule-arn arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:... \
  --actions Type=forward,TargetGroupArn=...,Weight=10

# Monitor error rates and latency
# Increase traffic in 25% increments every 30 minutes
```

#### 4.2 Monitoring Restoration
```bash
# Redeploy monitoring stack
helm upgrade prometheus-stack prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack \
  --namespace monitoring

# Import dashboard configurations
kubectl apply -f monitoring/grafana/dashboards/

# Verify alerting
curl -f http://prometheus:9090/-/healthy
curl -f http://alertmanager:9093/-/healthy
```

#### 4.3 Feature Validation
```bash
# Critical user flows testing
npm run test:integration:critical
npm run test:e2e:critical

# Performance benchmarking
k6 run --vus 50 --duration 5m performance-tests/critical-path.js
```

### Phase 5: Recovery Completion (3-6 hours)

#### 5.1 System Stabilization
- Monitor system metrics for 2 hours minimum
- Verify all automated processes (backups, monitoring, alerts)
- Confirm data replication is working
- Validate security configurations

#### 5.2 Post-Recovery Tasks
```bash
# Update DNS back to primary (if applicable)
aws route53 change-resource-record-sets \
  --hosted-zone-id Z123456789 \
  --change-batch file://restore-changeset.json

# Scale down disaster recovery resources
kubectl scale deployment dating-api --replicas=1 -n disaster-recovery

# Archive incident logs
